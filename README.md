Termoelectric Cryotherapy Device used to quickly, safely, and consistently cool sections of the body.

Theoretically if multiple devices were to be strategically placed over the human body ones body temperature could be
slightly reduced.  This could be beneficial in lowering a patients overall body temperature in the cases of severe fever or
heatstroke.

The device is no larger than a softball, does not need to be stored in a large freezer, can be setup and deployed in under
a minute, and holds consistent target temperature for prolonged periods of time.


Note:
This is a project that was done in my fourth semester of undergraduate studies at the University of Hartford. 
Collected documentation is incomplete at this time.
